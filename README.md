# Front End Web Development Portfolio
# Techdegree Project 9 - Capstone Portfolio

**Skills & Technologies Used:**

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- CSS Animations
- Google Fonts
- Flexbox
- Mobile-First Responsive Web Design

**Project Description:**

For this project I created all of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from scratch. I used Flexbox to layout and arrange all of the items of the web page. I used a mobile-first responsive web design. I used a Google font for all of the text of the website. I used Animate.css for all CSS animations. In the portfolio section I linked to all 8 of the Techdegree projects. The project images, when clicked all open up a modal image overlay that displays an enlarged screenshot of the project. The modal image overlay triggers a JavaScript event listener and trigger a fade in CSS animation via Animate.css and vice versa for when you close the modal image overlay with a fade out CSS animation via Animate.css. I added GitHub, Demo and Project Details buttons. The GitHub button links to the GitHub project repository, the demo button links to a live version of the project for the user to use and demo and the project details button opens up a modal overlay with full project details about the project. The project details button, when clicked triggers a JavaScript event listener and triggers a fade in CSS animation via Animate.css and vice versa for when you close the modal image overlay with a fade out CSS animation via Animate.css. I used SVG's for all social networking icons. I fulfilled the "exceeds expectations" requirements by adding a breakpoint for tablet displays, linking to more than 4 projects, using SVG images for all contact information icons and having multiple JavaScript interactions.
