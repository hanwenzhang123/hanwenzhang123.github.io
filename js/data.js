            <p>For this project I created all of the HTML & CSS from scratch. I used a Google font for all of the text of the website. For this design I used a mobile-first approach where I designed the mobile view of this project as the basis for the base CSS. I then added media query breakpoints at 768px and 1024px and styled those breakpoints respectively. I linked the navigation menu to the correct sections of the page. I fulfilled the "exceeds expectations" requirements by adding a skills section with my own custom textual content, by changing the background color of the main content section and added additional styling for links (ie, borders, hover states) and by using semantic HTML markup for all of the respective elements.</p>

            <p>This project was designed according to the provided mockups.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Exceeds Expectations Requirements:</strong></p>

            <p>Add an additional section to the page, such as a skills section. Don’t forget to create a working link to your new section in the navigation menu.</p>

            <p>Add at least TWO additional items to further style and enhance the portfolio:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A new background color for the navigation and/or main sections of the site.</li>
                <li>Change the color of at least one piece of text.</li>
                <li>Add one additional google font that is being used on the page.</li>
                <li>Any additional styling for links (ie, borders, hover states).</li>

I used Flexbox to arrange all the form inputs. I added a dropdown for the state form field. I added input checkboxes and their respective labels. I used placeholder text for the form fields. I used form validation for the required form fields. I fulfilled the "exceeds expectations" requirements by adding a different background color for the header and main sections of the website and by using a CSS transition for the focus state of the outline to fade into view when brought into focus by selecting the input fields.</p>

            <p><strong>Project Description:</strong></p>

            <p>For this project I implemented Sass. I converted the provided CSS into Sass by creating a "scss" folder and created sub-folders inside of the scss folder for the base, component, and utilities partials. I changed the normalize.css file into a Sass partial and saved it to the base folder. I created a typography partial and saved it to the base folder. I created different component partials that grouped together the major sections of the site. Inside of the utilities folder, I created variables and mixins partials. In each of the scss sub-folders, I created an _index.scss file. These files are used to import individual partials from each sub-folder. I created a styles.scss, which is used to import all of the _index.scss files from the sub-folders. I used Scout-App to watch the Sass directories for changes and then automatically imported those changes to their respective Sass files. I created 5 color variables. I created a variable to be used for all media queries. I fulfilled the "exceeds expectations" requirements by using a media query mixin for all media queries, by using nested selectors, by creating a hover effect for buttons, which lighten the button's background color by 15% and by adding a CSS transition so that the color change fades in.</p>

            <p>For this project I created all of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from scratch. I created an interactive photo gallery with the provided images and thumbnails for the "Lightbox" jQuery plugin. I arranged all the elements in the design with Flexbox. I used a Google font for all of the text of the website. I created a search input field for the JavaScript search filter. The gallery searches based on the captions of the images. I implemented a JavaScript list search filter from a w3schools search filter example. I implemented this search filter to search on the captions of the images and display the respective images based on the search criteria. I used a jQuery "Lightbox" plugin to display an overlay and a lightbox that can cycle through all the images of the photo gallery with their captions. I fulfilled the "exceeds expectations" requirements by using a mobile-first responsive design and by writing my own JavaScript code for a search filter, which I implemented from a w3schools list search filter example.</p>

            <p><strong>Project Description:</strong></p>

            <p>For this project I was supplied with the HTML and base CSS. I created all of the JavaScript code from scratch. The idea of this project was to create a letter guessing game that has the user guess the letters in a quote or phrase. The user gets five tries to guess the correct letters, if the user misses a letter one of the tries is lost. If the user guesses all the letters in the quote or phrase then a green overlay is displayed with a text message saying "You Won" and a button that says "Play Again". If the user loses the game by losing all 5 tries then a red overlay is displayed with a text message saying "You Lost" and a button that says "Play Again". The "Play Again" button for both turnouts resets and reloads the game. This project required the use of arrays, functions, event listeners, loops and conditional statements. I stored 5 different quotes in an array that were accessed by functions. I used an array, functions, event listeners, loops and conditionals to check if the provided keyboard buttons being pressed matched the letters of the current quote or phrase being used. If the guess was right the corresponding letters were displayed in the quote or phrase, etc... I fulfilled the "exceeds expectations" requirements by creating CSS transitons that fade in the letters of the keyboard and the quote or phrase as they are revealed and by adding an overlay and a reset button to reset the game to be played again for both game turnouts, win or lose; when the button is clicked it recreates the buttons on the keyboard and generates a new random phrase from the phrases array and sets the number of misses to zero.</p>

            <p>This project was designed according to the provided mockups.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Exceeds Expectations Requirements:</strong></p>

            <p>Create CSS transitions for each letter in the phrase display as they are revealed.</p>

            <p>Add a button to the “success” and “failure” screens that reset the game. You’ll have to recreate the buttons in the keyboard, generate a new random phrase, and set the number of misses to zero.</p>

            <p><strong>Project Description:</strong></p>

            <p>For this project I created all of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from scratch. I used Grid Layout and Flexbox to layout and arrange all the different sections of the web page. I used mobile-first responsive web design. I used a Google font for all of the text of the website. I used JavaScript to create an alert for tasks. For this alert I used string interpolation to add the HTML to the web page. I implemented charts using charts.js. I used JavaScript to import the data for the traffic chart via an object with data and labels. For all the other chart data and styling customization, I edited the object parameters used by the charts in JavaScript. I made all charts responsive. I used SVG's to implement the social networking icons in their respective cards. I edited SVG parameters to change the fill of each social networking icon. I used margins to fully align SVG's to the center of their containers. I implemented message sending functionality for the messaging section, where if you type a message into the message field and click send, it will send the data to the user specified and then clear the data from the message field. For the settings section I created custom toggle switches from a w3schools example. I also added a timezone dropdown field and a save button to save the settings to the browser using local storage. This project used JavaScript arrays, objects, functions, loops and conditionals. I fulfilled the "exceeds expectations" requirements by adding a notifications dropdown menu displaying all the recent activity by using a w3schools example that utilizes CSS and JavaScript, by adding functionality to show a different chart with animation for each navigation list item for the traffic chart, by adding autocomplete functionality to the user input field in the messaging section with a JavaScript widget called "Awesomplete" and by using local storage to save the settings in the browsers local storage for the settings section.</p>

            <p><strong>Project Description:</strong></p>

            <p>For this project I created all of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from scratch. I used Grid Layout and Flexbox to layout and arrange all the items of the web page. I used mobile-first responsive web design. I used a Google font for all of the text of the website. I created a searchable API employee directory using the Fetch API and a random user generator. The generator, generated user images, employee names, email addresses, phone numbers, addresses, and date of births. I used the Fetch API to import all the user data and parse that data using JSON. This project used JavaScript asynchronous call back functions, functions, arrays, loops, conditionals and object iteration. I fulfilled the "exceeds expectations" requirements by implementing a JavaScript list search filter from an example from the w3schools website that lets you filter and search the directory based on name and by creating an overlay and modal window that has detailed information about the employee and is browsable by clicking the arrow buttons, which lets you progress forward in the directory or progress backwards.</p>

            <p>This project was designed according to the provided mockups.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Exceeds Expectations Requirements:</strong></p>

            <p>Add a way to filter the directory by name. To do this, you’ll need to request a random user nationality that will only return data in the English alphabet. Note: you don't have to rely on the API to return search results. You'll need to write functionality that filters result once they already on the page.</p>

            <p>Add a way to move back and forth between employee detail windows when the modal window is open.</p>
